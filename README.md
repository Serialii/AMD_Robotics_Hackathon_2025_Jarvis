# AMD_Robotics_Hackathon_2025-main
The goal of this project was to develop a practical and helpful robotic companion capable of assisting with everyday tasks. We created Jarvis, a smart robotic arm designed to pick up objects, place them in designated locations, or hand them to a user upon request. Our primary focus was on creating a system that is intuitive, responsive, and reliable, providing meaningful assistance in everyday interactions.

#Scope of the project
1. Interact with our hand by giving and taking objects when we tell him to
2. Tic-Tac-Toe
3. Voice commands
